A brief introduction on MONAI (a PyTorch-based framework for deep learning in healthcare imaging) and my experience on MONAI bootcamp 2021 (https://www.gpuhackathons.org/event/monai-miccai-bootcamp-2021). All materials are [here](https://github.com/Project-MONAI/MONAIBootcamp2021).

I also introduced my own developed package seg-metrics (https://pypi.org/project/seg-metrics/): a simple package to compute different metrics for Medical image segmentation.
