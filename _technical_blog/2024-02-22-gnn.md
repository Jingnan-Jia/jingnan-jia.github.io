Graph neural network (GNN) is used for unstructured data. I created a [PPT](/files/gnn.pdf) for the general introduction on GNN.

## Blogs to introduce GNN in general

## GNN on medical images
We could regard each pixel (or voxel for 3D images) as a node in a graph, and then convert a image data to a graph data. Such conversion is memory efficient to save data and train networks for sparse data (like vessels).

## Python packages for GNN
`torch_geometric` is a library built upon  PyTorch to easily write and train Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). All the related documentation including public datasets, dataloaders, convolution layers could be found [here](https://pytorch-geometric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) and [here](https://github.com/pyg-team/pytorch_geometric). 

I strongly recommend to learn the package from the [official tutorials](https://pytorch-geometric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/get_started/introduction.html)

Different GNN designs and their implementations could be found [here](https://pytorch-geometric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/modules/nn.html#convolutional-layers)


## some tips
- The number of graph convolution layers is normally between 2 and 4. Deeper networks do not lead to better performance.
- Data augmentation is time-consuming for big graph data.
- GNN is super faster than CNN (about 10 times faster).
- You could read some surveys or overview papers to have a complete view about GNN.
