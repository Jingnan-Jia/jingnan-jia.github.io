You may think that `yourname.github.io` is not cool enough compared with `yourname.com`. No worries, we can change the domain.

1. Buy your prefered domain. I bought it from [namecheap](https://www.namecheap.com/). I strongly recommend you to also buy the SSL which can make your website more safe by starting with `https` instead of `http`. Some browsers will alear **unsafe** if your website starts with `http`.
2. After you bought your domain, you can go to the setting of you repository `username.github.io`, click `Code and automation`-> `Pages` -> `Custom domain` -> enter `www.yourname.com` -> `Save`.
3. Set DNS. Go to your domain provider website [namecheap](https://www.namecheap.com/), for example. Go to `Dashboard` -> `manage` -> `Advanced DNS`, set DNS like the following figure.
