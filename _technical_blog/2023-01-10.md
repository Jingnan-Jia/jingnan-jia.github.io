## Ranking of point cloud classification networks
1. [3D Point Cloud Classification](https://paperswithcode.com/task/3d-point-cloud-classification)

From the above link, it is observed that the most pupular datasets for point cloud classification is [**MOdelNet40**](https://modelnet.cs.princeton.edu/) and [**ScanObjectNN**](https://hkust-vgd.github.io/scanobjectnn/).

For **MOdelNet40** (released in 2015), in the top 10 networks, I first exclude the networks with extra training dataset, I can obtain:
- PointView-GCN
- RepSurf-U
- PointMLP+HyCoRe
- PointMLP
- PointNet2+PointCMT
- CurveNet
- RPNet

They are all published in 2021 or 2022.

For **ScanObjectNN** (released in 2019), I first exclude the networks with extra training dataset, I can obtain:
- PointNeXt+Local
- PointNeXt+GAM
- PointNeXt+HyCoRe
- PointNeXt
- PointStack

They are all published in 2022.

Why the top networks for two datasets are so different? Which network should I choose for my dataset (PFT regression from binary vessel tree)?

ModelNet40 is synthetic, while ScanObjectNN is real-world dataset.
