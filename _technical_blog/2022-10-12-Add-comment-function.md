# Add comment
Today I spent half day to add the comment function to my website.
To summarize, I should not use my custom comment script. I should use disqus as the comment engine whichis very beautiful.
I thought that disqus may have Ads, but actually the Ads only appears in front of my admin account instead of the website, which is ok.

The reason why I switched to use disqus is fro [his web](https://ibug.io/blog/2018/04/build-github-pages-with-travis-ci/)




# How to make github roll back to previous commit?
1. Github desktop (I downloaded it, but it did not work and I found its functions have been achieved by Pycharm)
2. Pycharm has the 'force push' button but it is grayed out. How to fix it?
    1. [Force push is disabled only for protected branches](https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/IDEA-226503#:~:text=Force%20push%20is%20disabled,Settings%20%7C%20Version%20Control%20%7C%20Git). master is protected by default. The list can be configured in Settings | Version Control | Git.
    
    
# Why the some pages of the website do not show the comments part even if I added it?
A: you need to wait for some time, maybe longer maybe shorter. About 10 minutes from my experience.
