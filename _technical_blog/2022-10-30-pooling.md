## 我发现Pooling会让CAM的分辨率降低，所以，为什么要用Pooling层或者stride>1的卷积层呢？

Answer: 
1. Push the model to be invariant to small [shift/rotation/scale](https://blog.csdn.net/YOULANSHENGMENG/article/details/121222429)/[perturbations](https://www.quora.com/Why-do-we-use-pooling-layer-in-convolutional-neural-networks) of the data。
2. [Reduce network complexity, make training easier](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/cnn-introduction-to-pooling-layer/#:~:text=Thus%2C%20it%20reduces%20the%20number%20of%20parameters%20to%20learn%20and%20the%20amount%20of%20computation%20performed%20in%20the%20network)
3. [Save time/computing](https://www.quora.com/Why-is-the-pooling-layer-used-in-a-convolution-neural-network)
4. [Increase reception field](https://www.zhihu.com/question/401688068#:~:text=2)-,%E6%B1%A0%E5%8C%96%E5%B1%82%E5%8F%AF%E4%BB%A5%E5%A2%9E%E5%8A%A0%E6%84%9F%E5%8F%97%E9%87%8E.,-%E4%B8%8D%E8%BF%87%E5%8D%B7%E7%A7%AF)

I do not believe it. Or I think PFT regression net **should** be sensitive to smalll (organ) perturbation. Pooling will lose such information. I want to try if No-Pooling can lead to the same performance.
