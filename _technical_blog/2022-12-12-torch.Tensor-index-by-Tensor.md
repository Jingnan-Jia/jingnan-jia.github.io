# How to index `torch.Tensor` using `Tensor`?
In `numpy.Aarray` or `torch.Tensor`, we have the following methods to index an `Array` or `Tensor`:

```
np_a = np.random.randn((30,4,5))
ts_a = torch.randn((30,4,5))
```

# 1. Basic indexing: `int` number to index one element 
```
tmp = np_a[1]
tmp = ts_a[1]
```
# 2. Less basic indexing: `start:end` to index a range of continuous elements
```
tmp = np_a[10:13]
tmp = ts_a[:13]
tmp = np_a[:-2]
```
# 3. Advanced indexing: index multiple elements in different positions ([Indexing with Arrays/Tensors of Indices](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/user/quickstart.html#advanced-indexing-and-index-tricks))
e.g. select the 1st, 3rd, 8th, and 29th element from np_a.

e.g. select the [0,0,0] and [1,1,1] and [20,1,2] three elements. 
# 

## Array with shape of [N,]
```
a = np.arange(12)**2  # the first 12 square numbers
i = np.array([1,1,3,8,5])
a[i]  # array([ 1,  1,  9, 64, 25])

j = np.array([[3, 4], [9, 7]])  # a bidimensional array of indices
a[j]  # the same shape as `j` array([[ 9, 16], [81, 49]])
```

## Array with shape of [N,M,...]

**Note:** The first and second method also apply to `list`.
